# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware Issue with Server Components

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15's App Router when using server components and middleware together.  The problem occurs when a server component attempts to access a protected route or data before middleware that handles authentication has a chance to execute.

## Problem Description

In the `pages` directory, middleware always runs before the page is rendered.  However, in the `app` directory with server components, if a server component attempts to access data that requires authentication, and this component is called before the middleware runs, it might result in unexpected errors.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Solution

To solve this problem, ensure the middleware correctly sets any necessary authentication headers or context, and the server component robustly handles the lack of authentication by either redirecting to a login page or displaying appropriate error messages.   In this example, we modify the server component to handle the absence of authentication gracefully and add error handling.
